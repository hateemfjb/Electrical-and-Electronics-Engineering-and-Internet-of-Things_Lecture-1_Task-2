## Introduction

In this project, you'll learn to interface an analog sensor with an Arduino Uno, using code to read and process input data for digital applications, with a focus on practical implementation.

## Project Tasks

1. *Design*: Plan the circuit layout to successfully integrate the chosen analog sensor with the Arduino Uno.
2. *Programming*: Write code that reads data from the sensor, processes it, and presents it in a human-readable format.
3. *Testing and Validation*: Ensure the system works accurately with various analog sensors and modify configuration as needed.

## Features

- *Analog Signal Conversion*: Converts analog inputs to digital data.
- *Real-time Monitoring*: Utilizes Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor to display live data.
- *Versatility*: Adaptable setup suitable for a variety of analog sensors.

## Hardware Requirements

- *Arduino Uno*
- *Analog Sensor* (e.g., LM35 temperature sensor, potentiometer)
- *USB Cable* for connecting Arduino to a computer
- *Breadboard* (optional for prototyping)
- *Jumper Wires*

## Software Requirements

- *Arduino IDE*: The essential tool for writing and uploading Arduino code.
- Ensure you have the latest version from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Circuit Connections

### Example: Connecting an LM35 Temperature Sensor

- *LM35 Vout* ➔ Connect to A0 (analog input on Arduino)
- *LM35 VCC* ➔ Connect to 5V (power supply)
- *LM35 GND* ➔ Connect to GND (ground)

### General Connection Steps

1. Connect the analog sensor’s output pin to the A0 pin on the Arduino.
2. Connect VCC from the sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
3. Connect GND from the sensor to any GND pin on the Arduino.

## Code

Here is a basic sketch for reading and displaying data from an analog sensor on an Arduino Uno:

cpp
const int sensorPin = A0; // Pin connected to the sensor output

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize the serial communication at 9600 baud rate
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // Read sensor value
  float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); // Convert to voltage

  Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
  Serial.print(sensorValue);
  Serial.print(" - Voltage: ");
  Serial.println(voltage);

  delay(500); // Wait before the next read
}


## Usage

1. *Upload the Code*: Open the Arduino IDE, paste the code, and upload it to your Arduino Uno.
2. *Start Monitoring*: Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl + Shift + M) in the Arduino IDE to observe the real-time sensor data.
